This repository contains all data sources and scripts that were used to perform all analysis in my thesis, which are based on the analysis for the following paper PMID: 31175153 (with a seperate repositoty: https://github.com/marsicoLab/xist_mediated_gene_silencing.git).

The folder data contains all required processed data (big raw files are not included), as well as data of modelling results.
The folder scripts contains all scripts needed to reproduce the obtained results, including pre-processing steps, modelling and interpretation steps.
The folder plots contains all plots generated for the thesis.
